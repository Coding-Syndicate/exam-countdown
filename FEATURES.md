## üï∞ Main Features

1. **Countdown Timer**
   - Counts down to the next upcoming exam.

2. **Smart Timer Transition**
   - When countdown hits `00:00`, switch to a **count-up timer** showing how long the exam has been running.
   - After the exam duration ends, resume countdown to the next exam.

3. **Exam Duration Awareness**
   - Each exam has a duration (e.g., 2h).
   - Count-up runs until duration is over.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Learning Goals

9. **Use TypeScript**
   - Rebuild the project in TypeScript to catch errors early and improve reliability.
   - Learn proper type definitions and avoid Java-style assumptions.

10. **Tailwind CSS for Styling**
    - Learn Tailwind by writing raw, utility-first classes.
    - Use classes like `line-through`, `text-white`, `text-gray-500`, etc.

11. **Raw DOM Manipulation First (Optional)**
    - Understand the core behavior before moving to frameworks like React.
